### Tick It

#### WDi-Project-1

My first Rails app completed during Web Development Immersive at General Assembly.

A simple project tracking app, users can create projects, add tasks for each project, and optionally add other Tick It members to their project.

A dashboard page provides a quick overview of current projects, listing complete and incomplete tasks.


Built with Rails v4.2
